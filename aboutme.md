My name is Nick LeDonne and I am an aspiring
actuary living in Chicago. I built this website as a proof of concept to
showcase my work and share a little bit about myself. My professional strengths
lie in data wrangling/summarization alongside model/tool development, but my
personal passions range from technology to fitness to coffee to beer.
